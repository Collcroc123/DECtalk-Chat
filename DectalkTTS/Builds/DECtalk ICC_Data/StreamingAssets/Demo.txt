DEMO. 
This is a demonstration of DECtalk Software text-to-speech technology.

DECtalk Software comes with an easy to use Force Computers Application 
Programming Interface, as well as Microsoft's Speech API, so you can 
make your applications speak.

The standard voices are Paul, [:nb] Betty, [:nh] Harry, 
[:nd] Dennis,[:nf] Frank, [:nu] Ursula, [:nr] Rita, [:nw] Wendy, 
[:nk] and I'm kit.

[:np] DECtalk Software can play sound files, [:play demo.wav]
dial telephone numbers, [:dial 1-800-297-4863] or generate tones.
[:tone 440,1000][:tone 880,1000]

DECtalk software has over 1,400 letter to sound rules, as well as
extensive text preprocessing, so it can properly speak monetary text: $1.25,
times: 12:31 pm, dates: Jan. 1, 1997, and phone numbers: 800-297-4863.

Feel free to type a personal message and have DECtalk Sofware speak it.  Select
the play button on the bottom right of this window, or highlight the text and 
click your right mouse button.

To find out how to use our in-line commands, such as changing voices, please
open the COMMAND.TXT file.

COMMANDS. 
Communicating with DECtalk[R] Software.
     
The  primary function of DECtalk[R] Software is to convert ASCII text
into synthesized speech output.  The DECtalk synthesizer includes its  
own set of built in rules for text processing, as  well  as  a  large integral dictionary, 
and application specific dictionaries can be created by the developer or user.
In addition, a large number  of control and status functions are available, 
these functions are  used to  modify  the  speech parameters of DECtalk Software.   
Some of the functions include selecting the speaking voice,  rate, volume, 
tone generation, and pause lengths. 

SPEECH CONTROL.
There are four ways to control speech in DECtalk Software:
1. Through ASCII text.  DECtalk speaks this text as  written according
to  a  set  of predefined rules. 

2. Through phonemic spelling.  If you were to phonemicize the sentence  'This
is  an  example of phonemic spelling', it would look like this: [:phoneme arpabet on]
[dh'ihs ihz  axn ixgz'aempel axv  faxn'iymixk sp'ehlixnx].
NOTE: To use phonemic symbols, the Phonemic spelling function it must be turned ON.

4. Through voice control commands.  These commands
control  features  of speech that are not obvious  from  the  visible
text,  such  as  sex  of  the speaker, and excitement  level.  

3. Through  speech control commands.  These easy to use,  in-line commands  
control  the  overall  operation   of   the synthesizer  as  well as its many 
special features.  Some examples of commonly used speech control commands are:

Changing voices:  [:name Betty] like Betty, [:name harry] or Harry. [:name Paul] 
Speaking  rate: [:rate 30] very slow, [:rate 400]or extremely fast, [:rate 200]
Tone generation: [:tone 1000,400] 
Spelling mode: [:say letter]test, [:say clause]
Math mode: [:mode math on] (4 * 10) / 8 = 5.  [:mode math off]
Speak through phoneme spelling:  [:phoneme arpabet on] [d'ehk#taok],
or Dial tones: [:dial "1,800-297-4863"]

EMAIL. 

Due to the growing e-mail market, users want to have access to their e-mail via
telephone. It is an important, however informal, mode of business communication. 
It includes various abbreviations, acronyms, playful graphics and un-punctuated 
sentences, which made e-mail reading almost impossible for most synthesizers.

The DECtalk technology has now incorporated new, specialized rules to better speak 
e-mail messages. This is accomplished by eliminating un-needed control information.
and interpreting the typical short cuts used in e-mail messaging.
 
In the example below, notice the e-mail header will be stripped to only speak the 
date, subject and sender, while the footer will be completely removed.  Also note 
that the abbreviations are expanded to their true form, E S T will be read as 
Eastern Standard Time and St. James St. will be voiced as Saint James Street.
