This project is currently functional, yet incomplete. I would love to return to this project when I have more time to flesh it out. The current roadblock is the UI, however I have since learned HTML, so I should be able to install the newer Unity UI system that uses HTML/CSS and create a much better looking program.<br><br>
Thanks for checking this out!
